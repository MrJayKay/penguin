 Free Code Camp Making a Penguin 


In this Free Code Camp Project I learnt CSS transforms to position and resize each part of this HTML and CSS art peice. I also learnt simple CSS animation to have the pengiun wave at you! "Hi!".


Things I would like to add or improve.

- Animate the eyes.
- Have the penguin move instead of staying static.
- Have the logo change colors.
- Add more details to the background.
